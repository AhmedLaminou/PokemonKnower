# PokémonKnower

A Convolutional Neural Network model capable of recognizing Pokémon from images.

still as its beginning and very flawed , but will upgrade later ! This is just the v1 version of my project !!!!

## 🧠 Overview
This project uses a custom dataset of Pokémon images to train a CNN using TensorFlow.  
The goal is to classify Pokémon from input images with high accuracy.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

## 📂 Dataset
Dataset used for training and testing:

## 📈 Model Performance
- Accuracy:53 %
- Evaluated on unseen Pokémon images

## 🏃‍♂️ Usage

### Train the model
```bash
python src/train.py
